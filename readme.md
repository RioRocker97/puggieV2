# Why am i coming back to Express.js Framework ?
The framework is pretty solid and already understand the basic structure of it. It's alot easier than using Angular5

PS. I should learn both framework

PS2. The follwing line of code will install "Essential" modules in Express.js
- npm install express
- npm install pug

Please dont put node_modules inside the git . it's messy!
